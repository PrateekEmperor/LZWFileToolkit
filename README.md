# LZWFileToolkit
Created a file compression tool using the LZW algorithm to reduce file sizes efficiently.
Developed functions for compressing and decompressing text files, handling ASCII characters.
Achieves over 20% size reduction for small files (5KB) and up to 50% for larger files, optimizing storage and transfer
efficiency.
